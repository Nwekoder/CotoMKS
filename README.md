## Hello
My name is Chandra Hasan, i'm a self-thaught programmer with mostly spending my time on Full Stack Web Development. I use Javascript/Typescript so often when creating web apps or just website for most of my project. I also use Python to automate my jobs at the office, that's the only stuff that i do with Python. I also C, C++ and PHP for some project that i working on, but not so often to have such project. My full time job is Web Developer, but i also teaching about Web Development, Networking and Server (Basic Linux stuff) to Vocational High School students every years for the past 3 years. Don't worry, that doesn't mean my programming skills not as good most programmers does. I have experience in Web Development since 3rd Grade Junior High School, so it's been 6 years since the first time i write my first HTML codes.
